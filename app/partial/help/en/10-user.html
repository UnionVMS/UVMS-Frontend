    <h2 help-section="user" index="10">Section 10 User</h2>

    <p>This section is a basic user guide for the USM (User Security Management) application v1.7.1, called the User (Management) module when integrated under U-VMS. Operations that can be performed in the user web interface are described in this section.</p>
    <p>The main roles of USM cover the user authentication, user authorisation and the management of user data and related data. More precisely:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>to store data about users that might have access to applications, their access rights and information about organisations;</li>
        <li>to authenticate users;</li>
        <li>to verify or disseminate the user access rights;</li>
        <li>to disseminate information about organisations</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Profile: Normal User</h4>
    <p>This list of actions may be triggered by any user of the U-VMS application.</p>
    <b>How to change my security answers</b>
    <p>Option 'Change security answers' from the user contextual menu:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user1.png">
    <p>A pop-up displays a list of questions and answers (mandatory fields are marked with a red '*'):</p>

    <img wrapped url="10-user2.png">
    <p>When activated for the first time, the list is empty. The user must choose a question in a list of predefined questions and provide an answer. The number of questions to be replied by the user is a parameter of the system (cfr Policies).</p>
    <p>If it is not the first time, the list is filled with the previous answers of the user. The user may modify the reply and/or to change the question.</p>
    <p>The system verifies that a question has not been selected more than once and that an answer has a minimum of three characters.</p>
    <p>This list of security questions is used when the user has forgotten his password (cfr How to request a password).</p>

    <b>How to update my personal data</b>
    <p>Option 'Update contact details' from the user contextual menu (mandatory fields are marked by a '*'):</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user3.png">
    <p>A pop-up displays the following user information that may be modified (mandatory fields are marked with a red '*'):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Phone number</li>
        <li>Mobile number</li>
        <li>Fax number</li>
        <li>Email</li>
    </ul>
    <img wrapped url="10-user4.png">
    <p>The "Password" field is not used to modify the password. It is a security channel to confirm the identity of the user. The 'save' button to commit changes is only active when the password has been filled in.</p>

    <b>How to change my password</b>
    <p>Option 'Change password' from the user contextual menu:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user5.png">

    <p>A pop-up appears where the user must enter the current password and two times the new one (mandatory fields are marked with a red '*'):</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user6.png">

    <p>Depending on the password policies put in place in the system (cfr Policies), the system performs some controls based on: a minimum length, minimum number of digits, minimum number of special characters (!""£$%^&’*(),./:@~<>+=-#), recent occurrence in the password history…</p>

    <b>How to request a password</b>
    <p>Two cases are possible:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first time: the user must follow the procedure put in place by the organisation for such case. If there is no official procedure, the administrator of the system must be contacted.</li>
        <li>Forgotten password: In the login screen, the option 'Forgot your password?' can be activated:</li>
    </ul>
    <img wrapped url="10-user7.png">
    <p>A pop-up is displayed to request the username (mandatory fields are marked with a red '*'):</p>
    <p>Therefore, two cases are possible:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The user has already filled-in the security questions (cfr How to change my security answers): if so, the security question panel is displayed with the set of questions chosen by the user. The user must enter the answers and two times a new password. If no problem is detected (i.e. the answers are correct and the new password respects the password policies (cfr How to change my password), a successful message is displayed. The user can enter in the log in screen again with the new password.</li>
        <li>The user has no security questions (cfr How to change my security answers): the email address of the user registered in the system is used to send him an email with a temporary password. At first log in, the user must change it.</li>
        <p>Example of email sent by the system:</p>
        <p>Here is your new password:</p>
        <p>u2y#rNs*T8</p>
        <p>Please login and change it.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to know my different profiles</h4>
    <p>Option 'Switch context' from the user contextual menu:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user8.png">
    <p>The list of contexts (role and scope) attached to the user is displayed:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user9.png">
    <p>The user may choose any context during his session. Depending on the selected context (and the permissions contained in), the web interface is automatically adapted to see only the options that the user may use.</p>

    <h4>How to log out from the system</h4>
    <p>Option 'Sign out' from the user contextual menu:</p> 
    <img wrapped url="10-user10.png">

    <h4>Profile: Administrator</h4>
    <p>This list of actions may be triggered by a user with special rights on the USM system.</p>

    <b>How to find back User information & Access Rights</b>
    <p>User information is accessible through the 'USERS' option from the main menu:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user11.png">
    <p>The web screen provides a set of filters to find back the users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name search: a set of characters can be provided. The search is performed on the Username, First Name and Last Name. The position of the characters entered for the search in the data is not important; </li>
        <li>Nation: a selection of one entry in the list of countries registered in the system; </li>
        <li>Organisation: a selection of one entry in the list of organisations managed by the system;</li>
        <li>Status: a selection of one entry in the list of user statuses defined in the system;</li>
        <li>Active from: date from which users can be active in the system;</li>
        <li>Active to: date until when users can be active in the system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The result of the search is displayed below the set of filters:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user12.png">
    <p>When there is no data corresponding to the search criteria, the message 'No result found.' is displayed.</p>
    <p>If the search is successful, the list of users matching the criteria is displayed. For each user, the icon gives access to detailed user information in three tabs:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user13.png">
    <ul>
        <li>Contact and Status Details: user information;</li>
        <li>Contexts: user rights (see context definition);</li>
        <li>Preferences: user preferences;</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to change a User password</h4>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <img wrapped url="10-user14.png">
       <p>Note that this feature is not possible through USM if the system use an Identity Management (IDM) system.</p>
    </div>
    <p>If so, the management of passwords must be done in that system and the corresponding option(s) in USM are not active.</p>
    <p>If the management of passwords is delegated to USM, the following actions should be done:</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>To find back the user: cfr How to find back User information</li>
        <li>For that user, to select the option for detailed user information. In the web screen, the option 'Set Password' is visible.</li>
        <li>The administrator may enter twice a new password for the user.   </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The communication of that new password to the user is not covered by the system.</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user15.png">
    <h4>How to create a User </h4>
    <p>The following actions should be done:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To select the option 'USERS' in the main menu</li>
        <li>In the web screen, the option <b>'New User'</b> is visible:</li>
    </ul>
    <img wrapped url="10-user16.png">

    <p>There are two ways of creating a user depending on the technical environment in place:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Using a IDM
            <p>The user interface allows a USM Administrator to pull (copy) information from an external Identity Management (IDM) system (e.g. LDAP,  Active Directory) to complete the user information stored in USM.</p>
            <p>With an IDM, some user information (depending on how USM is interfaced with: cfr the USM Admin guide & USM IDM setup guide) will be copied into USM. When imported, such information should not be updated anymore because the official source is considered to be the IDM. (a next version of USM will prevent that action)</p>
            <p>The procedure is the following: the username must be inserted first. Then the option 'Copy Info From LDAP' is triggered. User information from the LDAP is copied in USM if the username entered in the web screen matches an existing username in the IDM. If not, an error message 'User not found' is displayed.</p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user17.png">
            <p>Some other user information needs to be filled in before finally saving the data  (cfr next point).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Using USM as source for all user data
            <p>The following data should be provided (mandatory fields are marked by a red '*'):</p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user18.png">
            <ul>
                <li>Username: it must be unique. If not , an error 'User already exists' is generated when saving data;</li>
                <li>First name</li>
                <li>Last name</li>
                <li>Email: it must contain a '@' to be valid;</li>
                <li>Telephone number</li>
                <li>Mobile number</li>
                <li>Fax number</li>
                <li>Active from</li>
                <li>Active to</li>
                <li>Organisation: only the 'enable' organisation are proposed (cfr Organisation management)</li>
                <li>Status:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enabled: the user is active. It is the default value.</li>
                    <li>Disabled: the user is no more active. He may not log-in in any UVMS module.</li>
                    <li>Locked: the user may not log-in in any UVMS module. This status is mainly managed by the system when the user access should be (temporarily) deactivated due to a violation of a security policy (wrong password entered multiple times …) cfr Policies management.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When data is saved, the user has still no password and no access right. Please see the corresponding entries in this document to complete the process.</p>
                <li>A note</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to give access rights to a User</h4>
    <p>The first action is to find back the user: cfr How to find back User information.</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user19.png">
    <p>Then, two options are possible:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To clone an existing user profile
            <p>In such a case, all access rights (more precisely the contexts) from another user will be copied to this user. To do so, the action is triggered by clicking on the following icon at the level of the user entry in the user panel:</p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user20.png">
            <p>A pop-up is displayed where the administrator can pick-up a reference user from whom the contexts (role/scope/preferences) must be copied to the user. All the contexts of the reference user are displayed for information. When the 'Copy profile' option is triggered, a message indicates that any previous access rights of the user receiving the new profile will be deleted.</p>
            <p>The new profile of the user can be later extended (cfr next option).</p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user21.png">
        </li>
        <li>
            To create or change contexts
            <p>To do so, the action is triggered by clicking on the following icon at the level of the user entry in the user panel: </p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user22.png">
            <p>In the 'Contexts' tab, the permissions (if any) of the user are available:</p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user23.png">
            <p>A new context can be added to the profile of the user with the 'New' option: </p>
            <p>A pop-up is displayed where the administrator must choose a role and optionally a scope:</p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user24.png">
            <p>The system verifies if the context (role/scope) does not exist already for the user. If not, the profile of the user is modified.  If the user is connected in U-VMS when the operation is performed, the impacts (new permissions …) will only take place at the </p>next <p>user session.</p>
            <p>The same screen is proposed when updating a context with the icon: </p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user25.png">
            <p>Deletion of a context is also possible with the icon: </p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user26.png">
            <p>By clicking on the existing roles or scopes, the corresponding screens to view the content ( permissions or datasets) are displayed with options to manage them. It should be noted that in such case, the modifications done on a role or a scope affect all users <p</p>>having the element in their context(s) (Cfr How to manage Roles and How to manage Scopes).</p>
            <img wrapped url="10-user27.png">
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to manage Organisations and related information</h4>
    <p>The option 'Organisations' in the main menu is the entry point:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user28.png">
    <p>An organisation may provide technical information for one or multiple endpoints. Each endpoint may have one or more communication channels and a list of contact people.</p>

    <b>Organisation</b>
    <p>The web screen provides a set of filters to find back an existing organisation:</p>
    <img wrapped url="10-user29.png">
    <ul>
        <li>Name search: a selection of one entry in the list of organisations created in the system; </li>
        <li>Nation: a selection of one entry in the list of countries proposed by the system;</li>
        <li>Status: a selection of one entry in the list of organisation statuses defined in the system;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The result of the search is displayed below the set of filters. </p>
    <p>When there is no data corresponding to the search criteria, the message 'No result found.' is displayed.</p>

        <li>Fax number: new value is any</li>
        <li>Email: new value is any</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The icon available in each entry of the list gives access to the validation screen.</p>
    <p>The old and new values are displayed with options to reject, accept or cancel the operation:</p>
